# Feather HUZZAH NodeBot

Put Javascript on a Feather because... Javascript!

This is home of the content for the CodeMash 2017 NodeBots Workshop. While this workshop has come to an end, you can still access the detailed instructions, photos, and troubleshooting tips for building a Feather HUZZAH NodeBot and controlling it over WiFi on the [Wiki](https://github.com/hxlnt/feather-nodebot/wiki).

Some parts of this challenge, such as the Azure RoboWriter dashboard and contest details, are not applicable to those looking to build a Feather HUZZAH NodeBot at home. If you want plain code without the CodeMash-specific dashboard reporting, take a look at the file `index-withoutdashboard.js` instead of `index.js`.
